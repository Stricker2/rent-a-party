# Rent A Party

## Project Description
Rent A Party is a MERN stack single-page application that allows users to rent party equipment and supplies. Users choose products from various categories and add the desired quanity to their shopping cart. Users are able to sign up with their name, email, and password. They can log in once their user profile is created.  Links at the top of the page take users between "home", "login", and "signup". The shopping cart is toggled on the upper corner of the homepage and can be opened and closed with the click of a button. 

This was completed as part of a group project at the culumination of the full-stack development course. We used a variety of technologies, described below, to complete the application. We collaborated by communicating frequently, dividing tasks between grouop members, and supporting each other by celebrating successes and finding solutions to problems as a team.
